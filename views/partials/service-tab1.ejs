                <p style="font-size: 18px;">Android is a mobile operating system developed by Google, based on the Linux kernel and designed
                    primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Android's user interface
                    is mainly based on direct manipulation, using touch gestures that loosely correspond to real-world
                    actions, such as swiping, tapping and pinching, to manipulate on-screen objects, along with a
                    virtual keyboard for text input. In addition to touchscreen devices, Google has further developed
                    Android TV for televisions, Android Auto for cars, and Android Wear for wrist watches, each with a
                    specialized user interface. Variants of Android are also used on notebooks, game consoles, digital
                    cameras, and other electronics.</p>
